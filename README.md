## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Technical Informatics student at Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences with a strong passion for embedded systems and smart hardware development.

I enjoy building innovative projects that bridge software and electronics — from sensor-based IoT platforms like the Dynamic Translator Board to automated systems such as the Cash Dispenser Project.

💡 I focus on:
- Embedded systems development  
- Sensor integration & hardware communication  
- C++ system programming  
- Structured and scalable system design  

I am a detail-oriented and hands-on engineer who enjoys transforming ideas into reliable real-world solutions.
